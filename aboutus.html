    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>gen-z.com delivered the best products since 2005.Title: Finally, a Shop That Gets It.
The Problem: We were tired of scrolling through endless sites that didn't share our values or our style. Everything felt mass-produced and faceless.
Our Solution: Gen-Z.com was built to be the anti-corporate marketplace. We curate [Insert Product Category] that doesn't just look good but does good.
The Receipts:
-Ethical Only: 100% of our partners sign our Fair-Work pledge.
-Planet First: We use biodegradable packaging because the planet isn't a trend.
-Real People: We're a small team based in [City], hand-picking every item you see here.
